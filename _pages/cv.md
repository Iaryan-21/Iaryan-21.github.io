Education
======
* M.Eng in Robotics, University of Maryland, College Park (Expected: May 2025)
* B.Tech in Electronics and Communication, Vellore Institute of Technology (June 2023)


Work experience
======
* Generative A.I - Software Developer (November 2024 - Present)
  * National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S Dept. of Commerce
  * Work: Part of NIST's Gen A.I program. Responsible for development of pipeline and evaluation metrics to able to identify whether a multi-modal input is authentic or fabricated.


* Machine Learning Researcher (August 2024 - Present)
  * Dept of Statistics, University of Maryland, College Park
  * Work: Generated and evaluated high-dimensional data: Used intrinsic Gaussian processes with heat kernel mapping and manifold regularization for classification and regression. Optimized conditional GANs with novel penalty-based objective functions to enhance image realism.


* Machine Learning Researcher (January 2024 - December 2024)
  * Dept of Mechanical Eng., University of Maryland, College Park
  * Work: Deployed VNET with attention mechanism on the Stanford Type B Aorta Dissection dataset, achieving a Dice Coefficient of 0.80, Jaccard Mean of 76.3, AsD Mean of 0.98, and Dice Overlap of 92.3%. Developed a transformer-based encoder for VNET. Designed soft robotic grippers with 3D-printed bases and machine learning models to predict object properties from Pressure-Volume curves and tactile data.

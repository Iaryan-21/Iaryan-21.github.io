## Project Overview
Developing advanced trajectory prediction systems to enhance autonomous vehicle decision-making under uncertainty.

## Key Developments
- Engineered a Multiple Trajectory Prediction (MTP) model to address path uncertainties in self-driving scenarios
- Implemented probabilistic modeling to:
  - Generate multiple feasible trajectory paths
  - Calculate likelihood scores for each predicted path
  - Enforce geometric constraints using angular thresholds
- Validated model performance using the comprehensive NuScenes dataset

## Technical Details
The project focuses on robust trajectory prediction by considering multiple possible future paths rather than a single deterministic outcome. By incorporating probabilistic modeling and geometric constraints, the system produces more reliable and realistic predictions for autonomous vehicle navigation. This approach significantly improves the vehicle's ability to handle complex traffic scenarios and uncertain road conditions.

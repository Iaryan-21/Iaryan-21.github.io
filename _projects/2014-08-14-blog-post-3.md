## Project Overview
Developed state-of-the-art segmentation techniques for Type B Aortic analysis using hybrid deep learning architectures.

## Key Achievements
- Implemented attention-enhanced VNET architecture achieving superior performance metrics:
 - Dice coefficient: 0.880
 - Jaccard index: 0.4437
 - 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95): 22.2
 - Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD): 13.51

## Technical Implementation
- Created high-quality ground truth segmentation labels for patient CT scans using SimVascular
- Currently developing a novel hybrid architecture combining:
 - VNET base architecture
 - Custom transformer encoder
 - Attention mechanisms for enhanced feature extraction

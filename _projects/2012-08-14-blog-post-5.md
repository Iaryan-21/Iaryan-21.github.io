## Technical Implementations
- **Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN)**
 - Dataset: MNIST
 - Application: Digit generation and style transfer
 
- **CycleGAN**
 - Dataset: Summer to Winter Yosemite
 - Application: Seasonal image transformation
 
- **Progressive GAN**
 - Dataset: CelebA
 - Application: High-resolution face generation

## Performance Achievements
- Successfully generated high-fidelity images across all architectures
- Achieved stable training convergence
- Demonstrated versatility across different image domains:
 - Handwritten digits
 - Natural landscapes
 - Human faces
